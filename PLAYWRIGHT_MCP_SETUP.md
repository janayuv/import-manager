# Playwright + MCP Setup Complete

## Overview
Successfully set up UI/UX testing with Playwright + accessibility (axe-core) and exposed it via MCP for running tests from Cursor.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. âœ… Dependencies Installation
- Playwright and axe-core were already installed in the project
- Added `@axe-core/playwright` for accessibility testing integration

### 2. âœ… Test Files Created

#### `tests/ui.spec.ts`
- **Homepage Loading Test**: Verifies the Tauri dev server loads correctly
- **Font-Size Elements Test**: Checks for visible heading elements or text elements
- **Table Visibility Test**: Verifies tables are visible and responsive
- **Screenshot Test**: Takes visual regression snapshots
- **Responsive Design Test**: Tests different viewport sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)

#### `tests/accessibility.spec.ts`
- **General Accessibility Scan**: Uses AxeBuilder to check for WCAG violations
- **Keyboard Navigation Test**: Verifies tab navigation works
- **Color Contrast Test**: Ensures color contrast meets accessibility standards
- **Image Alt Text Test**: Checks for proper image alt attributes
- **Form Labels Test**: Verifies form elements have proper labels
- **Heading Structure Test**: Checks heading hierarchy (excluding h1 requirement for dev page)

### 3. âœ… Playwright Configuration Updated
- Updated `playwright.config.ts` to use correct port (1421)
- Set test directory to `./tests`
- Disabled webServer configuration to allow manual dev server control
- Configured for multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

### 4. âœ… Custom MCP Server Created

#### Location: `D:/tools/playwright-mcp/`
- **simple-mcp.js**: Custom MCP server implementation
- **package.json**: Dependencies for the MCP server
- **test-mcp.js**: Test script for the MCP server

#### MCP Tools Available:
1. **`run_ui_tests`**: Runs all Playwright UI tests with list reporter
2. **`run_accessibility_tests`**: Runs only accessibility tests with JSON reporter

### 5. âœ… Cursor MCP Configuration Updated
Updated `c:\Users\Yogeswari\.cursor\mcp.json` to include:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": { /* existing config */ },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["D:/tools/playwright-mcp/simple-mcp.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Use

### Running Tests Manually
```bash
# Run UI tests
npx playwright test tests/ui.spec.ts --reporter=list

# Run accessibility tests
npx playwright test tests/accessibility.spec.ts --reporter=list

# Run all tests
npx playwright test --reporter=list
```

### Running Tests via MCP in Cursor
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. In Cursor, use the MCP commands:
   - `/mcp run_ui_tests`
   - `/mcp run_accessibility_tests`

## Test Results

### UI Tests Status
- âœ… Homepage loads correctly (port 1421)
- âœ… Font-size elements are visible
- âœ… Table visibility and responsiveness
- âœ… Screenshot capture for visual regression
- âœ… Responsive design across viewports

### Accessibility Tests Status
- âœ… General accessibility scan (no violations)
- âœ… Keyboard navigation (when interactive elements exist)
- âœ… Color contrast compliance
- âœ… Image alt text compliance
- âœ… Form labels compliance
- âœ… Heading structure (excluding h1 requirement for dev page)

## Technical Details

### Port Configuration
- Vite dev server runs on port 1421 (configured in `vite.config.ts`)
- Playwright tests updated to use correct port
- MCP server configured to run tests in the correct project directory

### Browser Support
Tests run on:
- Chromium (Chrome/Edge)
- Firefox
- WebKit (Safari)

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.0 AA compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Color contrast requirements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Add More Test Coverage**: Expand tests to cover more application features
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Set up baseline screenshots for comparison
3. **Performance Testing**: Add performance benchmarks
4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure consistent behavior across browsers
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port Conflicts**: Ensure dev server is running on port 1421
2. **MCP Server**: Restart Cursor if MCP tools don't appear
3. **Test Failures**: Check that dev server is running before executing tests

### Commands for Debugging
```bash
# Check if dev server is running
curl http://localhost:1421

# Run tests with debug output
npx playwright test --debug

# Run tests with headed browser
npx playwright test --headed
```
