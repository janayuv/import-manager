### 2. **ESLint Security Rules** (`eslint.config.js`)

- **Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **Plugin**: `eslint-plugin-security` installed and configured
- **Custom Rules**:
  - SQLite encryption enforcement
  - Hardcoded secrets detection
  - Security best practices enforcement
- **Test Results**: Successfully blocks unencrypted SQLite usage
- **Usage**: `npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx,.yml,.yaml`

### 3. **Pre-commit Security Hooks**

- **Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **Files**:
  - `.husky/pre-commit` (Shell version)
  - `.husky/pre-commit.ps1` (PowerShell version for Windows)
- **Checks Performed**:
  - ESLint security rules
  - Custom security scanner
  - npm audit
- **Test Results**: Successfully runs all security checks before commits

### 4. **Comprehensive Security Documentation**

- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **File**: `SECURITY.md`
- **Contents**:
  - Security implementation guide
  - Usage instructions
  - Best practices
  - Troubleshooting guide

### 5. **Security Test Suite**

- **Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **File**: `scripts/test-security.js`
- **Test Coverage**:
  - ESLint security rules
  - Custom security scanner
  - Pre-commit hooks
  - Documentation verification
  - Test file existence
- **Test Results**: All tests passing

## 🔍 **SECURITY ISSUES DETECTED**

The security implementation successfully identified and flagged the following security issues:

### **Critical Issues Found**:

1. **Hardcoded Credentials** in `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx:17`
   - Username: `'Jana'`
   - Password: `'inzi@123$%'`
   - **Risk**: High - Credentials exposed in source code

2. **Unencrypted SQLite Usage** in `src/db/test.ts`
   - Multiple instances of `new sqlite3.Database()` without encryption
   - **Risk**: High - Data stored in plaintext

3. **Hardcoded Secrets** in multiple files:
   - Tauri signing keys in configuration files
   - Private keys in various locations
   - Bearer tokens and API keys

4. **Insecure GitHub Actions** in `.github/workflows/insecure-test.yml`
   - Hardcoded private keys in YAML
   - **Risk**: High - Secrets exposed in CI/CD

---

## 🛡️ **SECURITY ENFORCEMENT STATUS**

### **Active Protections**:

- ✅ **Pre-commit blocking**: Security issues prevent commits
- ✅ **ESLint enforcement**: Code quality and security rules
- ✅ **Automated scanning**: Continuous security monitoring
- ✅ **Documentation**: Clear security guidelines

### **Security Rules Enforced**:

1. **SQLite Encryption**: Must use SQLCipher with PRAGMA key
2. **Secret Management**: No hardcoded secrets allowed
3. **CI/CD Security**: GitHub Secrets must be used
4. **Code Quality**: Security best practices enforced
